# Internal Linking Rules

- Always link to the pillar hub page.
- Add 2-4 links to sibling articles in the same pillar.
- Add 1-3 links to relevant articles in other pillars.
- Keep links natural in-body and list them again in the "Enlaces internos" section.
- Use relative URLs compatible with static routing.
