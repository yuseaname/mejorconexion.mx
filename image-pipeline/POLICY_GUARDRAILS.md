# Policy Guardrails

This pipeline enforces AdSense-safe, performance-friendly imagery.

## Prohibited imagery patterns
- Ad-like banners, CTA button visuals, or pricing badges
- Promotional or sales messaging
- Product-only centered packshots
- Any UI mockups or readable on-screen text
- Logos, brands, or trademarked artwork

## Required constraints
- Photorealistic, real-world scenes
- Natural lighting and authentic moments
- No visible text or UI elements
- Avoid staged or overly polished compositions

## Placement safety
- Insert only in content-focused containers
- Avoid nav, sidebar, footer, and ad-like sections
- Always include width/height for CLS protection
