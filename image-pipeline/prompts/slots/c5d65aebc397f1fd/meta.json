  "prompt_text": "Photorealistic hero image representing the real-world meaning of the topic: Internet en Guadalajara: qu\u00e9 conviene por zona.\n\nFirst, interpret what this topic implies to a general audience in everyday life (e.g., confusion, problem-solving, reassurance, discovery, resolution). Then visually represent that meaning through a realistic moment or situation.\n\nThe scene must depict a believable, real-life scenario where the topic would naturally apply, not a staged setup or symbolic arrangement of objects.\n\nShow a single, specific moment in time that a human would immediately recognize as related to the topic (pause during problem-solving, inspection, realization, before/after state, subtle signs an issue is being addressed).\n\nAvoid generic desk setups, flat-lay compositions, or repeated object arrangements.\n\nDiversity: time_of_day=midday, room_type=bedroom, camera_angle=from doorway, subject_context=elderly resident, environment_style=suburban home\n\nCamera:\nFull-frame camera, 35mm lens. Natural perspective, slight imperfections allowed. Human eye-level or contextual angle (not overhead).\n\nLighting:\nNatural or practical indoor lighting. Time-of-day cues allowed. No dramatic, cinematic, or studio lighting.\n\nStrict constraints:\n- No visible text.\n- No UI elements or readable screens.\n- No diagrams, icons, or symbols.\n- No branding, logos, or overlays.\n- No symmetry-heavy or stock-photo compositions.\n- No product-only centered shots.\n- No pricing badges, stars, or CTA button shapes.\n- No promotional or advertisement-style imagery.\n\nStyle:\nStrict photorealism. No CGI, no illustration, no surreal elements.\n\nThe image should feel like a real photograph taken during an authentic moment related to the topic, clearly understandable without explanation.\n\nUnique composition guardrail:\nDo not reuse visual compositions, object groupings, or scene layouts from previous images. Each image must feel like a different household and a different moment.\n\nCultural realism:\nThe scene must feel authentically Mexican, reflecting everyday life in Mexico.\nArchitecture, interior design, appliances, and environments should match common Mexican homes or businesses.\nAvoid U.S. suburban styles, European interiors, or luxury-only environments.\nPeople should look naturally Mexican, not model-like or staged.",
